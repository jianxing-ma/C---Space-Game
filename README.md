# C---Space-Game
Prototype of a space game
Space Cowboy

This game is dedicated to the memories of childhood nintendo games that our generation had all played. The idea is creating a rpg type console game that allows player to navigate through different maps and ecounter all kinds of situations such as: trading in stores, dicovering gold, getting robbed by bandits, walking into mazes and so on. The goal is to make enough money and beat the game.

The application currently has the basic foundation up and working, and the next goal would be introducing encoutering enemy and level-up system which would bring the game playing experience to another level.
